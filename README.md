ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m Matt Robinson, currently working at Arrow Electronics in sales operations in our AIS division.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data analytics and data science
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on projects to further develop my SQL and Tableau skills
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™ve recently learned SQL and data visualization tools, as well as the software for this space (like SQLite, MySQL, Github). Would like to grow and eventually learn Python.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any projects that are practical implications for the real world and eventually some behavioral economics data
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: LinkedIn is great
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm bilingual and currently learning a 3rd language (Spanish)
